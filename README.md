# <Jerimiah's Code Refactor Challenge Project>

## Description

The original code lacked semantic elements, and the client wanted to be more accesible to vision-impaired users, as well as improve their search engine optimization. Building this project allows the client to have a better result when being searched on the web, a more consolidated, organized code base that can allow for easier changes to be made in the future. During the course of this project, I learned to follow semantic code structure, the importance of using semantic elements for both SEO and vision impaired users.
